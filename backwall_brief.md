# Backwall Creative Brief - REVISED

## Dimensions & Technical Specs
- **Printable Area**: 100cm (W) × 217cm (H)
- **Bleed**: 5mm on all sides
- **Safe Zone**: 50mm inset from edges for all critical text and logo elements
- **Visual Obstruction Zone**: Bottom 80cm will be partially obscured by chair backs and table
- **Optimal Viewing Zone**: 80cm - 217cm from ground (137cm of fully visible height)
- **No-Text Zone**: 30cm × 80cm bottom-left area must remain free of text (background can extend through)

## Design Hierarchy & Layout

### 1. Hero Element: Face/Eyes (Top Third)
- **Position**: Upper portion, approximately 170-200cm from ground
- **Treatment**: Upper half of face (forehead to mid-cheek/nose), eyes looking directly at viewer
- **Integration**: Soft gradient fade/vignette at edges, blending into background
- **Effect**: Face should "emerge" from the brand colors naturally
- **Color Treatment**: Apply subtle blue color overlay or use gradient fade to harmonize with brand palette
- **Optional Detail**: Subtle headset/earbud visible if natural to composition

### 2. Primary Message (Middle/Eye Level)
- **Text**: "AI Roleplay for Sales Teams"
- **Position**: Centered, 120-160cm from ground (prime eye-level viewing zone)
- **Typography**: Ubuntu family, bold weight
- **Color**: White text on blue background (or navy on light blue section depending on gradient)
- **Priority**: Must be readable from 3-5 meters away
- **Treatment**: High contrast, generous spacing

### 3. Skylar Logo (Supporting Element)
- **Position**: Either 100-120cm range OR 190-200cm range (to avoid competing with main message)
- **Size**: Secondary to headline, clearly visible but not dominant
- **Color**: Standard brand colors

## Color & Background Strategy

### Background Approach
**Gradient Sophistication** (Recommended):
- Deep navy/royal blue at bottom (around 0-80cm, partially obscured zone)
- Smooth transition to lighter blue/white toward top (where face emerges)
- Creates vertical depth and draws eye upward naturally
- Face emerges from lighter top section with soft fade

**Alternative**: Clean minimal with solid deep blue + subtle geometric accents (abstract lines/dots suggesting connection/conversation)

### Brand Color Usage
- Honor core Skylar teals and supportive neutrals
- Blue tones should harmonize with face photography
- Maintain clean, modern aesthetic without overwhelming color

## Tone & Visual Style
- **Modern tech + human warmth**: Not cold corporate, not overly playful
- **Confident and aspirational**: Professional growth narrative
- **Approachable**: Subverts typical aggressive sales imagery
- **Premium but accessible**: High-end tech branding feel
- **Story**: Real people practicing and improving their craft

## Key Design Principles
1. **Stopping Power**: Direct eye contact from face creates immediate psychological connection
2. **Clarity**: Message must be instantly readable and understandable
3. **Integration**: All elements (face, text, logo, background) must feel cohesive through color harmony
4. **Vertical Flow**: Design should guide eye from face → message → logo naturally
5. **Distance Readability**: Consider viewers will see this from 3-10 meters away

## Assets Provided
- Face/eyes photograph (supplied)
- Skylar logo (supplied)  
- Brand color palette and design system (reference)
- Typography: Ubuntu family

## Production Notes
- Consider chair obstruction below 80cm when placing critical elements
- Ensure gradient transitions are smooth in print
- Test readability of text at distance
- Verify face/background blend looks natural, not collaged
