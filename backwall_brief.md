# Backwall Creative Brief

- **Primary Message**: "AI role plays for sales teams" set in Ubuntu type, with the words as the hero element.
- **Logo Usage**: Include the Skylar logo, keeping it secondary to the headline but still clearly visible.
- **Tone & Style**: Minimal artwork; clean, brand-aligned aesthetic using the app design system as reference without overwhelming color usage.
- **Layout Priorities**:
  - Headline must be dominant and immediately readable from a distance.
  - Logo placement should support the message without stealing focus.
- **Brand Alignment**: Honor core Skylar colors (teals and supportive neutrals) and typography (Ubuntu family) from the design system.
- **No-Text Zone**: Respect the 30 Ã— 80 cm no-copy area on the bottom-left of the backwall; background can continue through it.
- **Production Constraints**: Maintain 5 mm bleed, keep all critical content within the 50 mm safe inset, and design inside the printable height of 217 cm.
